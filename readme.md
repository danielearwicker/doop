I'm going to pretend the name stands for:

     Declarative Object-Oriented Persistence

* *Persistence* in the sense of immutable data structures, nothing to do with
I/O serialization.

* *Declarative* in that decorators are used to drive metaprogramming that takes
care of all the behind-the-scenes implementation stuff for you.

But really it's a [Futurama reference](http://futurama.wikia.com/wiki/Democratic_Order_of_Planets).
